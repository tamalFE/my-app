What I have done on this repository below I write  down step by step:-


1. First of all I go to terminal to create my app. (npx create nest-app).

2. Then to create a simple and single Next.js project I ignore all the extra feature from that.

3. Lastly I create a about folder on app directory to check this project it's Ok or not.
